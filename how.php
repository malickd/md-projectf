                    <p>Nimba runs on the Android operating system. This wearable-technology device maintains a relatively persistent wireless connection to your mobile device—usually a smart phone—and can receive notifications of incoming calls, texts, instant messages, social-network updates, and more, from that device.</p>

                    <p>It can also let you accept and conduct phone calls right on the watch. It also acts as smart phone all on its own, without needing a paired phone nearby. Like smart phones, it can also run apps, via your smart phone or right on the watch. These include health and fitness, apps that control functions such as music and the camera on your phone, navigation apps, and more.</p>

                    <p>We are coming up with new and innovative apps that can increase the functionality of the devices. Reserve yours today!</p>
